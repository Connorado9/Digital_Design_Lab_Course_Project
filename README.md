# Digital_Design_Lab_Course_Project
This project showcases the creation of an embedded system that reads temperature measurements, sends them via Bluetooth to a connected phone every 3.1 seconds, and switches between Celcius and Fahrenheit on command. Furthermore, an LED illuminates if the temperature exceeds 80 degrees F. Temperature readings are taken from the Si7021 sensor on the EFM 32 Pearl Gecko microcontroller board that the embedded system runs on. Drivers for the low energy timer that controls the timing between LED illuminations, a scheduler that maintains the lowest possible energy mode throughout all the applications, an interrupt driven I2C state machine that interfaces with the Si7021 sensor, a low energy UART that transmits to and receives from the bluetooth module, and a circular buffer that holds data going to peripherals while other applications are producing it were coded in C in Simplicity Studio to govern the project.
